        The default behaviour is to fall back to the bundled certificates when
        no system certificates can be found.  If you're packaging ``jnrbase``
        *please* set ``ALLOW_FALLBACK`` to ``False`` to disable this very much
        unwanted behaviour, but please maintain the option so that downstream
        users can inspect the configuration easily.
